# Memory response of GMR gels dataset

  

*The dataset contains six sets of data. Including recordings of placement of single pieces of magnets of different shape and sequential placement of a combination of shapes.*

  

## sqr_and_cir_a.npy

  

This dataset contains the data for the sequential placement of circular and square shaped magnets. The index to refer to each placement of magnetic event is:

for squares

`[195567, 786462, 1219327]`

for circles

`[8698, 912093, 1438514]`

The index to refer to each removal of magnetic event is:

for squares

`[275514, 850106, 1276297]`

for circles

`[68177, 955910, 1496824]`

  

## tri_and_sqr_a.npy

The index to refer to each placement event is

`[105996, 1764996, 3539995]`

The index to refer to each removal event is

`[164996, 1839995, 3634994]`

in which 1764996 and 1839995 refers to the placement/removal of the triangle and the other two refers to those of the square.

  

## cir_a

The index to refer to each placement event is

`[27999, 310999, 540999, 825999]`

The index to refer to each removal event is

`[117999, 394999, 594999, 899999]`

  

## sqr_a

The index to refer to each placement event is

`[83999, 485999, 767999, 1165999]`

The index to refer to each removal event is

`[135999, 545999, 845999, 1237999]`

  

## tri_a

The index to refer to each placement event is

`[1, 221999, 601999, 879999, 1141999, 1519999]`

The index to refer to each removal event is

`[57999, 291999, 671999, 959999, 1245999, 1619999]`

  

## all_a
The index to refer to each placement event is

`[10, 271010, 673010]`

The index to refer to each removal event is

`[104010, 323010, 763010]`
